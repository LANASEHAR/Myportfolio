  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <section class="overview">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SoftMind is a non-clinical mental health tracking app created as a UX concept project.
      The goal was to help users recognize emotional patterns, reduce stress, and build emotional awareness
      without overwhelming them with data, dashboards, or complex interactions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- ROLE -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      I worked as the sole Product Designer, responsible for user research synthesis,
      UX strategy, interaction design, UI decisions, and high-fidelity prototyping.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Many mental health apps unintentionally increase cognitive load by presenting
      dense dashboards, frequent tracking prompts, and excessive data visualization.
      For users experiencing anxiety or decision fatigue, this complexity can create
      additional stress instead of relief.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- USER -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>User Persona</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Adam — 30 years old</strong><br>
      Office employee experiencing daily anxiety spikes, mental fatigue,
      and difficulty making decisions after long workdays.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- OBJECTIVE -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>UX Objective</h2>
    <p>
      Reduce decision fatigue and emotional friction by designing
      a predictable, reassuring experience that supports emotional regulation
      without demanding excessive user effort.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STRATEGY -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>UX Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use a calm color palette with soft contrast to avoid overstimulation</li>
      <li>Limit text and choices per screen</li>
      <li>Map emotional states clearly without clinical terminology</li>
      <li>Maintain predictable navigation to reinforce a sense of safety</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- FLOW -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>User Flow</h2>
    <p>
      1. User opens the app during a moment of stress<br>
      2. Immediate emotional check-in with minimal input<br>
      3. Guided calming action (breathing, reflection, pause)<br>
      4. Gentle positive reinforcement<br>
      5. Exit the app without cognitive fatigue
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- DECISIONS -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Soft, warm color palette to promote emotional safety</li>
      <li>Rounded shapes and spacing to reduce visual tension</li>
      <li>Short, supportive microcopy instead of instructional text</li>
      <li>No dashboards, scores, or productivity metrics</li>
    </ul>

  <!-- IMPACT -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Results & Key Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      This concept demonstrates how reducing cognitive load and emotional friction
      can create a sense of calm and safety for users.
      The project reinforced the idea that UX design can act as a form of emotional regulation,
      not just an interface for data interaction.

  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>What I Would Improve Next</h2>
    <p>
      With more time and user testing, I would validate emotional check-in patterns,
      test different reinforcement messages, and explore lightweight personalization
      while maintaining the app’s calm and non-intrusive nature.
