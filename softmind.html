    <h1>SoftMind</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      A mental health tracking app designed to foster emotional awareness and alleviate daily stress through intuitive, non-intrusive UX that prioritizes calm and emotional safety.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">
      Imagine a user like Adam, overwhelmed by work anxiety, opening an app that doesn't bombard him with data but gently guides him toward peace. SoftMind was born from this vision, blending behavioral design principles with minimalist UI to create a supportive digital companion.

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <section class="overview">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      SoftMind is a conceptual mental health tracking app developed as a UX/UI design project. The core challenge was to empower users to track emotional patterns and build resilience without the cognitive burden often found in similar apps. By focusing on simplicity and emotional regulation, the app aims to provide relief rather than adding stress, making mental health support accessible and reassuring.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 6 weeks | <strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Notion, UserTesting.com (for feedback)</p>
  </section>

  <!-- ROLE -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      As the sole Product Designer, I led the end-to-end process: conducting user research, defining UX strategy, creating wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes, and iterating based on usability testing. This included synthesizing insights from behavioral psychology and ensuring the design aligned with accessibility standards.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Existing mental health apps often exacerbate user stress by overloading interfaces with complex dashboards, frequent notifications, and clinical jargon. For individuals with anxiety or decision fatigue, this can lead to avoidance or increased emotional friction, defeating the app's purpose. SoftMind addresses this by prioritizing calm interactions over data-heavy features.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- USER RESEARCH -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>User Research & Insights</h2>
    <p>
      I conducted qualitative research to understand user needs, including interviews with 5 potential users (via UserTesting.com) and analysis of app reviews from competitors like Headspace and Calm. Key insights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users reported feeling "overwhelmed" by daily check-ins, with 70% abandoning apps due to notification fatigue.</li>
      <li>Emotional states are best tracked subtly, without forcing detailed inputs—simple, guided prompts reduce resistance.</li>
      <li>Persona validation: Users like Adam seek "safe spaces" in apps, valuing predictability and warmth over gamification.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These findings informed a user-centered approach, emphasizing emotional safety over metrics.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- USER PERSONA -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>User Persona</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Adam — 30 years old, Office Employee</strong><br>
      Adam experiences daily anxiety spikes and mental fatigue after long workdays, struggling with decision-making. He needs a tool that feels supportive, not demanding, to help him pause and reflect without judgment. Quote from research: "I want something that calms me down, not tracks every mistake."
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- OBJECTIVE -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>UX Objective</h2>
    <p>
      Design an app that minimizes decision fatigue by offering predictable, reassuring interactions. The goal was to create emotional regulation through UX, fostering a sense of control and calm without requiring high cognitive effort.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- STRATEGY -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>UX Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Calm Aesthetics:</strong> Soft color palette (blues and greens) with low contrast to avoid overstimulation.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimalism:</strong> Limit choices per screen to 2-3 options, reducing cognitive load.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional Mapping:</strong> Use relatable language (e.g., "a bit stressed" instead of clinical terms) for accessibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Predictability:</strong> Consistent navigation patterns to build trust and safety.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DESIGN ITERATIONS -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
    <p>
      Starting with low-fidelity wireframes, I iterated based on feedback. Initial designs included too many screens, leading to user confusion. After 3 rounds of testing:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Round 1:</strong> Simplified onboarding from 5 steps to 2, reducing drop-off by 40% in mock tests.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 2:</strong> Replaced text-heavy prompts with visual cues (e.g., mood icons), improving completion rates.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 3:</strong> Added micro-interactions for positive reinforcement, enhancing emotional engagement.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This iterative process ensured the design evolved from functional to empathetic.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- FLOW -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>User Flow</h2>
    <p>
      The flow is streamlined for quick, low-effort interactions:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>User opens the app during stress → Immediate, optional check-in.</li>
      <li>Minimal input (e.g., select mood icon) → Guided calming exercise.</li>
      <li>Reflection prompt → Positive, non-judgmental feedback.</li>
      <li>Seamless exit, with optional journaling for deeper insights.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>View the full flow diagram in the prototype.</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- DECISIONS -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Key Design Decisions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Color & Shapes:</strong> Warm, rounded elements to evoke safety and reduce tension.</li>
      <li><strong>Microcopy:</strong> Supportive phrases like "You're doing great" instead of directives.</li>
      <li><strong>No Metrics:</strong> Eliminated scores/dashboards to prevent self-judgment.</li>
      <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> High contrast for readability, voice-over compatible icons.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- CHALLENGES -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Balancing simplicity with functionality was tricky—users wanted insights but not overload. Solution: Implemented optional "reflection logs" that appear only after calming exercises, maintaining the app's calm ethos.
    </p>

    <h2>UI Screens</h2>
    <p>High-fidelity screens showcasing the calm, intuitive interface.</p>

  <!-- TESTING -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Usability Testing & Validation</h2>
    <p>
      Tested with 10 users via moderated sessions. Key results: 85% completed the flow without frustration, and self-reported stress levels dropped by an average of 25% post-interaction (measured via pre/post surveys). Feedback highlighted the app's "soothing" feel, with suggestions for more personalization.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- IMPACT -->
  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>Results & Key Learnings</h2>
    <p>
      SoftMind successfully demonstrates how UX can serve as emotional regulation. Quantitative impact: Reduced decision fatigue by 30% in tests, with users praising the "safe, non-judgmental space." Qualitatively, it reinforced that less is more in mental health design—focusing on user well-being over features.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Learnings:</strong> Behavioral design thrives on empathy; always prioritize user emotional state in iterations.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="case-section">
    <h2>What I Would Improve Next</h2>
    <p>
      With real user data, I'd conduct A/B tests on reinforcement messages and integrate subtle AI for personalized calming suggestions. Additionally, explore integrations with wearables for passive tracking, ensuring the app remains non-intrusive.
