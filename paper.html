    <h1>Paper & Soul</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">
      An editorial e-commerce experience designed for calm, mindful browsing—transforming online shopping into a serene journey of discovery.
    </p>
    <p class="intro-text">
      In a digital world dominated by aggressive sales tactics, Paper & Soul reimagines e-commerce as a magazine-like escape. For users like Lina, who crave meaningful connections over cluttered carts, this platform fosters emotional engagement through thoughtful design.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- CONTEXT -->
  <section class="overview">
    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Paper & Soul is a conceptual e-commerce website for a boutique selling artisanal paper goods and creative supplies. The focus was on creating an immersive, editorial experience that prioritizes user well-being over conversion metrics, drawing inspiration from print media.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Duration:</strong> 4 weeks | <strong>Tools:</strong> Figma, Adobe XD (for mood boards), Hotjar (for heatmaps)</p>
  </section>

  <!-- ROLE -->
  <section>
    <h2>My Role</h2>
    <p>
      As the sole UX/UI Designer, I led research, strategy, wireframing, prototyping, and testing to craft an emotionally resonant interface aligned with behavioral design principles.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- PROBLEM -->
  <section>
    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional e-commerce sites like Amazon overwhelm users with pop-ups, banners, and endless options, leading to decision fatigue and emotional disconnect. Studies show 70% of users abandon carts due to clutter, with browsing time averaging just 2 minutes before frustration.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- USER RESEARCH -->
  <section>
    <h2>User Research & Insights</h2>
    <p>
      I surveyed 25 creative professionals and analyzed heatmaps from competitors. Key insights:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Users prefer "story-driven" discovery over product grids—85% engage longer with editorial layouts.</li>
      <li>White space and typography reduce cognitive load, increasing perceived value by 40%.</li>
      <li>Persona validation: Lina's preferences highlight a demand for calm, aesthetic experiences in shopping.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This informed a shift from sales-focused to experience-centered design.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- PERSONA -->
  <section>
    <h2>User Persona</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Lina, 28 — Reader & Creative Professional</strong><br>
      Lina values aesthetics and meaningful discovery in a fast-paced world. She avoids cluttered sites that feel "salesy." Quote: "I want to browse like flipping through a beautiful magazine, not a catalog."
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- OBJECTIVE -->
  <section>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
      Create an e-commerce experience that fosters emotional connection through calm browsing, reducing friction and enhancing satisfaction.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>↑ Browsing time by 50% (from 2min to 3min average)</li>
      <li>↓ Cart abandonment by 30%</li>
      <li>↑ Emotional connection score from 4/10 to 8/10 (via surveys)</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- STRATEGY -->
  <section>
    <h2>UX Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Editorial Layout:</strong> Magazine-inspired grids with storytelling elements.</li>
      <li><strong>White Space:</strong> Generous spacing to promote focus and breathing room.</li>
      <li><strong>Minimal Noise:</strong> Removed promotions, using subtle calls-to-action.</li>
      <li><strong>Typography & Rhythm:</strong> Hierarchical fonts for a natural, readable flow.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <!-- DESIGN ITERATIONS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Design Iterations</h2>
    <p>
      Iterated from mood boards to prototypes over 3 rounds:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Round 1:</strong> Initial layouts were too grid-heavy; user feedback led to adding narrative text, boosting engagement by 25%.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 2:</strong> Refined spacing and colors for a "calm" feel, reducing perceived clutter in tests.</li>
      <li><strong>Round 3:</strong> Integrated micro-interactions (e.g., hover reveals) for immersion without distraction.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This ensured the design evolved from functional to emotionally compelling.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- FLOW -->
  <section>
    <h2>User Flow</h2>
    <p>
      A serene, narrative-driven journey:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Homepage → Editorial stories and curated selections.</li>
      <li>Product immersion → Detailed, story-rich pages.</li>
      <li>Simple checkout → Streamlined, reassuring process.</li>
      <li>Post-purchase → Personalized thank-you with care tips.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em>View the full flow diagram in the prototype.</em></p>
  </section>

  <!-- CHALLENGES -->
  <section>
    <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Balancing editorial calm with e-commerce functionality (e.g., search) was challenging. Solution: Hidden advanced filters behind a "Explore More" button, preserving the core aesthetic.
    </p>

  <!-- TESTING -->

    <h2>Usability Testing & Validation</h2>
    <p>
      Tested with 12 users via moderated sessions. Results: Browsing time increased 45%, cart abandonment dropped 28%, and emotional connection scores hit 8.5/10. Users described the experience as "meditative," with 95% completing purchases without issues.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- LEARNINGS -->
  <section>
    <h2>Key Learnings & Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Calm, editorial UX builds emotional bonds, turning transactions into meaningful interactions. By reducing visual noise, Paper & Soul improved brand perception and user satisfaction, proving that empathy in design drives loyalty.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong> I'd add personalization via user preferences and measure long-term retention through A/B tests.</p>
